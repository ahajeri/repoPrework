## Project Analysis

As part of your pre-work submission, please reflect on the app and answer the following questions below:

Question 1: "What are your reactions to the Android app development platform so far? 
             Compare and contrast Android's approach to layouts and user interfaces in past platforms you've used."

Answer: Android studio has built on large frameworkd which support native app that makes easy development compare to Xamarin and Cordova. 
        I have worked on Xamarin and Cordova both does not provide layout support and xml is fastest way to prototype and code for UI and front end interface of application
 
Question 2: "Take a moment to reflect on the `ArrayAdapter` used in your pre-work. How would you describe an adapter in this context and what is its function in Android? Why do you think the adapter is important? Explain the purpose of the `convertView` in the `getView` method of the `ArrayAdapter`."

Answer:  ArrayAdapter is to update view on change of array values.
